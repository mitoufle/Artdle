# Gemini Assistant for Artdle

This document outlines the role of the Gemini assistant in the development of the Artdle project.

## Project Overview

**Artdle** is a deep art-themed idle game where players embark on an endless journey of artistic progression and mastery. The game is being developed using the **Godot 4** game engine and **GDScript**.

The core gameplay revolves around unlocking and combining different art forms to earn credits and unlock powerful new features, with the ultimate goal of becoming the most renowned artist in the galaxy.

## Architecture

The global game state is managed by a singleton located at `scripts/GameState.gd`. This file is the single source of truth for all player data, including currencies, upgrades, and progression.

## My Role as Your Assistant

As the Gemini assistant, my primary purpose is to help you, the developer, build and improve Artdle. I will assist with a wide range of tasks, including:

*   **Implementing new features:** I can help you write the GDScript code for new game mechanics, UI elements, and backend systems.
*   **Fixing bugs:** I can help you identify and fix bugs in the existing codebase.
*   **Improving code quality:** I can help you refactor your code to make it more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Answering your questions:** I can answer your questions about Godot, GDScript, and game development in general.

## User Preferences

*   Always show all lines in files.
*   Do not over compliment and stay factual.

*   **Quality of Life Improvements:** I can help you write the code for the tutorial system, save/load functionality, and audio integration. I can also help you refactor the UI to improve its usability.
*   **Bug Fixes:** As bugs are identified, I can help you debug the code and implement fixes.

I am ready to start working on the project. Please let me know what you would like to work on first.
